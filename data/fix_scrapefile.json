The most common type is a single pump, run by a motor. This has a compartment for moving the water around with an impeller and another compartment for draining that has its own impeller. If this is the type of dishwasher pump you have, check the drain impeller first. The pump is a stack of components, which you\u2019ll need to unstack to get at the impeller. Take out the bottom dish rack, the spray arm under it, the cover to the pump and the filter parts. Check if the drain impeller is damaged or worn out, and put in a new one if it is. Make sure the impeller can move freely. Spin the food chopper carefully to check its action: large food bits should not be able to slip past it. Make sure the motor is running in the right direction. If it\u2019s not running at all, use a multi-meter to make sure there is power at the terminals. If it has no power, make sure the door switches, and the timer/electronic control are sending electricity out on that circuit. If there is indeed the correct amount of power at the motor terminals, ascertain whether the motor windings are open. If the motor is making a loud humming noise, the motor may have seized or the drain impellor could be jammed. In that case, you may need a new motor or a combination motor/pump assembly. If your dishwasher has two pumps instead of one, check the drain pump to see if something is blocking the input and output. Make sure that, during the drain cycle, power is coming to the drain pump motor. Check the impeller, as described above. If impeller is sound, the drain pump\u2019s unobstructed, and the motor\u2019s receiving power, check the terminals and windings as described above. Replacing the pump and motor assembly may be the next step. For those dishwashers that drain via the main pump using a drain solenoid and a diverter flapper or valve, check that the solenoid gets power, and that it has continuity.

Turn off the cold water inlet valve and attach a hose to the drain valve that can be placed into a floor drain opening. Open the drain valve as well as a nearby hot water faucet to allow air into the tank while it drains. Use caution as the water will be very hot! Tip: before turning off the inlet valve and draining the tank, open a hot water tap in the home and allow the hot water to run until it drops to a safe temperature. Drain until the water level is below the opening for the element. Use the proper size socket or an element wrench to remove the old element. Remove the damaged gasket and clean the surface on the element and the opening in the tank before installing the new gasket and the element.

To test a brushless stator, the wires from the stator to the electrical panel will first need to be removed.

The meter should give a resistance measurement that is within the manufacturers specifications. A reading outside of this spec will indicate a bad winding. Perform this test on both power windings. The next test will check for a short between the windings and ground. The manufacturer will specify which stator lead to use for this test. Set the multi-meter to test resistance. One test lead will be connected to the stator lead specified by the manufacturer, and the other lead will be connected to a clean frame ground on the generator.

This can happen over many years due to normal wear or can happen quickly if the trimmer is overloaded or abused. Lack of lubrication can also be an issue. Lack of lube alone won\u2019t cause the gearbox to seize but damage caused to the gears from the lack of lube will. In other words you can\u2019t just add lube to a gearbox that is not working and have it work again. The lack of lube will cause damage to the gearing which will then need to be replaced. Remove the trimmer head assembly to access the gearbox. If the gearbox is broken and still will not function properly, it will need to be replaced."}, "Water Pump__Engine runs but does not pump water__Clutch": {"appliance": "Water Pump", "appliance_url": "https://www.fix.com/repair/lawn-and-garden/water-pump/", "symptom": "Engine runs but does not pump water", "symptom_url": "https://www.fix.com/repair/lawn-and-garden/water-pump/engine-runs-but-does-not-pump-water/", "abstract": "Find out why your water pump will not pump water, even while the engine is running, with our repair help.
