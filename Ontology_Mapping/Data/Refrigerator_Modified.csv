Universally,Refrigerator,N/A,N/A,Broken compressor pump,No Fluid,Check the front of the fridge for breaks or leaks,Multimeter,Fix the water valve,"Turn off the household supply to this valve and remove the input tubing to check to see if it has a little debris screen on it that may have gotten clogged. If so, clean the screen to allow water back into the ice machine. Check the inlet tubing for blockage, and make sure the manual water shut-off valve is clean and clear on the inside. If the ice maker fill tube has iced over, it could be that you need greater household water pressure to keep water flowing into the icemaker, or it could be that there’s dirt or a defect in the water inlet valve. Before you decide to replace the water valve, check to ensure power is reaching it properly. To check the electrical function of the water inlet valve, unplug the refrigerator and shut off the water supply to it. Remove the back panel and trace the water tube from the ice machine to the valve, to discover the solenoid inlet valve responsible for switching on the water flow. Test that solenoid with a multi-meter to determine if it has continuity. The electricity that runs to this solenoid originates in the ice maker control.",Multi-meter
